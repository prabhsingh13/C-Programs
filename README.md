# C-Programs
<p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that was originally developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world and is commonly used for developing system software, such as operating systems, as well as application software, such as databases and games.</p>

<p>C is known for its efficiency, simplicity, and ability to manipulate memory at a low level. It is compiled into machine code, making it faster and more efficient than interpreted languages. C also allows for direct access to computer memory, which can be useful for low-level system programming.</p>

<p>Some key features of C include its use of variables, data types, control structures, and functions. Variables are used to store data and can be of different types, such as integers, floats, and characters. Control structures, such as if-else statements and loops, allow for the execution of specific code based on certain conditions.</p>

<p>Functions are a key part of C programming, as they allow developers to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces of code. C also has a standard library of functions that can be used for common tasks, such as input/output operations and string manipulation.</p>

<p>Overall, C programming is a powerful and widely used language that is popular among developers for its efficiency and ability to manipulate memory at a low level. However, it also requires a certain level of expertise and understanding of computer hardware and memory management, which can make it more challenging for beginners to learn.</p>

<p>This repository includes some of the basic Programs of C-Programming. </p>
<h4>Some key syntax rules for C programming include:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Statements must end with a semicolon (;).</li>
  <li>Curly braces ({}) are used to group statements into blocks.</li>
  <li>Parentheses are used to specify the order of operations.</li>
  <li>Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
  <li>Reserved words, such as "if," "for," and "while," have specific meanings and cannot be used as variable names.</li>
  <li>Data types, such as int, char, and float, are used to declare variables.</li>
  <li>Function declarations and definitions must include a return type, function name, and parameter list (if any). </li>
  <li>Comments can be added to code using the // or /* */ syntax.</li>
<ul>
