# C-Programs
This repository includes some of the basic Programs of C-Programming. 
Some key syntax rules for C programming include:

Statements must end with a semicolon (;).
Curly braces ({}) are used to group statements into blocks.
Parentheses are used to specify the order of operations.
Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Reserved words, such as "if," "for," and "while," have specific meanings and cannot be used as variable names.
Data types, such as int, char, and float, are used to declare variables.
Function declarations and definitions must include a return type, function name, and parameter list (if any).
Comments can be added to code using the // or /* */ syntax.
